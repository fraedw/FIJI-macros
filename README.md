Allows simple processing steps such as smoothing or bleach correction.
Can generate a 2-channel composite with choice from processed or unprocessed projected channels.
Macro runs on an experiment file that contains individual movie files. Each movie file contains a "Raw" file that contains the individual xyz stacks generated by metamorph.
